# Sahil-Amin-F28WP-Repository
This Repository was made for the purpose of Heriot Watt University's Web Programming Course's coursework. 

This Repository will be update at least once a week with code related to the creation of a website, including HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Version Control, including but limited to branching, merging, and rollbacks, will have a heavy involvement with this Repository. Though the aim of the Repository is to complete a coursework, it's true goal is to make sure I am prepared and ready to use Github in the working world.
